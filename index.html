    <h2>Background story:</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My passion with computer science started early. I was always interested
      with how computer work and how it was created. and this interest was
      obvious to my family and friends. when I was in middle school, My journey
      with programming has begun with me learning c++. It has given me the
      fundamentals need to break into the journey of studing CS. Now, I'm in
      college trying to learn new staff everyday. and how to apply them to the
      real world.
